= Spring Boot Functional configuration adapters

This Java library provides a collection of `ApplicationContextInitializer` that
leverage Spring Boot auto-configurations to register the same beans but in a functional
way. For now, it mostly targets the Reactive stack and conditions are not managed yet.

Ideally in the future, such library should be generated during Spring Boot build based
on `spring-boot-autoconfigure` classes.

The dependency to use is `org.springframework.fu:spring-fu-autoconfigure-adapter`.
