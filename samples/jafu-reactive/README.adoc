= Jafu reactive webapp

This is an experimental sample reactive webapp with Jafu configuration (Kofu variant in Java).

This Java variant has following limitations compared to Kofu
 - Restricted DSL capabilities
 - It is necessary to specify the class in the `Supplier` variant of register Bean because of the lack of https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/inline-functions.html#reified-type-parameters[reified type parameters]
 - Require using static methods for extensibility due to the lack of https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html[extension mechanism]
