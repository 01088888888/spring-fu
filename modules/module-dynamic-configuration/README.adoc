= Spring Fu dynamic configuration module

This module provides an alternative to the regular Spring Fu application configuration
designed to allow writing configuration using data classes in Kotlin scripts
(`*.kts files`).

It allows to benefits of auto-complete in the IDE and avoid learning a
new format for your properties and is well suited for dynamic or remote configuration
loading for example.

The main drawback is the size of the Kotlin compiler dependency (almost 20M) and the time, CPU
and memory required for compiling the script, that's why it is not used by default.
