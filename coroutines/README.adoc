= Modules

Modules are JAR libraries intended to augment Spring Fu minimal core with support for various Spring projects and JVM technologies. To use them, you just need to add the relevant ones to the compile dependencies of the project, as you would do with a Spring Boot starter, to have access to additional capabilities.

`build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
dependencies {
	implementation(project("org.springframework.fu.module:module-foobar"))
}
```

The module configuration DSL is then available as a configuration https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html[extension] and needs to be configured since with Spring Fu configuration is always explicit.

`Application.kt`
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = application {
	foobar {
		feature1(param = 123)
		feature2(param = "Hello world")
	}
}.run()
```
