= Kofu DSL for Spring Boot

Kofu (for **Ko**tlin and **fu**nctional) is an alternative way of configuring explicitly your Spring Boot application,
different from regular auto-configuration, using a Kotlin DSL. It is based on Spring Boot infrastructure, but
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-fu/tree/master/autoconfigure-adapter[used via functional bean definitions]
instead of JavaConfig.

See documentation on the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-fu[root README].
